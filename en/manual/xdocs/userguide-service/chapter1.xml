    <title>Product Introduction</title>

    <para>eformsign is an electronic document solution which allows anyone to
    easily create electronic documents from paper documents in companies and
    utilize various data stored in electronic documents. You can easily create
    electronic documents by uploading your PDF files onto eformsign and
    converting the files to electronic forms via eformsign's Web Form Designer
    feature. You can also create electronic forms by using eformsign's add-in
    feature set in Microsoft Office (named Form builder or OZ in Office). The
    Form builder feature allows anyone who knows how to use the Microsoft
    Office Suite to easily convert existing documents to electronic
    forms.</para>

    <para>eformsign allows you to create a workflow for each template
    according to your company's business process. You can flexibly set a
    document signing process for internal documents as well as for external
    documents such as contracts, agreements, and applications. Furthermore,
    detailed configurations such as alerts and required input fields can be
    set for each workflow step or recipient, and the progress status of
    documents is logged as history. Moreover, an audit trail certificate is
    provided for documents for the prevention of document forgery and
    falsification.</para>

    <para>eformsign also provides a bulk send feature which allows to create
    and send multiple documents at once by minimizing repetitive input. Also,
    fields in documents such as author, group, recent input value, and date
    are automatically filled in by adding custom fields. Furthermore,
    eformsign allows to easily manage companies' members and their permission,
    configure detailed alerts settings for documents, and manage and utilize
    extracted data.</para>

    <para>The eformsign solution also provides an electronic signature feature
    which allows you to sign e-signatures on electronic documents.</para>

    <para>Digital signature is a signature in electronic form that replaces
    the traditional wet-ink signature. Just as when signing a signature on
    paper, you need to prove that the signer is you, and this is done by going
    through an identity verification step. Email, social security number,
    password, phone number, certificate, etc. are used as a means of identity
    verification.</para>

    <para>Digital signatures are legally binding in the vast majority of
    countries around the world, and the rest are implementing its legality in
    phases.</para>

    <para>eformsign’s e-signatures are legally binding for
    individual-individual and corporation-individual matters. As well, it
    provides various additional features for non-repudiation.</para>

    <note>
      <para>The following describes the legal effect of e-signatures of some
      regions.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>South Korea: Digital signatures based on PKI standards have a
          strong legal status, and their legality is not discriminated
          against. According to Section 3.3 of the Digital Signature Act, a
          digital signature other than a certified digital signature shall
          have such an effect of a signature, signature and seal, or name and
          seal, as is agreed between the parties concerned.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>USA: Under the principle of “technologically neutral”, any
          preference to more sophisticated or more secure technologies such as
          PKI is not given. There are many cases of increasing the reliability
          of e-signatures through identity verification or authentication
          services.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>EU: Digital signatures are categorized into Qualified
          Electronic Signatures (QES), Advanced Electronic Signatures (AdES),
          and general electronic signatures, and their legal status is applied
          accordingly, corresponding to the characteristics of each type of
          document.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Japan: With the existence of a specific verification system, a
          stronger legal effect is given to digital signatures authorized by
          the secretary of the state for each type of task.</para>
